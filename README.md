# IMDB_Rating
In this Repository I have created a website which will show the IMDB rating and more information about the movie.


Index.html is my main file. You have to run it to get my page. Index.html is backed with indexStyle.css and indexJS.js. I am using fetch method to get records from the API call. I have logged in IMDB Form which is giving me 1000 free api calls per day.

In mainMovie Page I have written code to show details of the Movie. It will Show all about the movie.

In FanMovie Page it will fetch the data from myData variable. In this variable I am storing the ID's of the IMDB records. I am making call based on those ID's and from the records which I am getting I am using them to add details in the elements.


Note- My last project was failed. I scored 33 out of 50. I didnt understand why I failed the project. So even if you are passing or failing me please provide me some feedback so that I can improve my self. And try to get it evaluated early. I am working so it have become very difficult for me to get time for this.
